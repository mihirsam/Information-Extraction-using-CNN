      "World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. \n",
      "The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. \n",
      "A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. \n",
      "World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. \n",
      "It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war. \n",
      "Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with China by 1937, though neither side had declared war on the other. \n",
      "World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. \n",
      "From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. \n",
      "Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. \n",
      "Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the Fall of France in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire. \n",
      "On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history. \n",
      "This Eastern Front trapped the Axis, most crucially the German Wehrmacht, into a war of attrition. \n",
      "The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. \n",
      "War in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the long Battle of the Atlantic followed. \n",
      "Tribunals were set up by the Allies and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and the Japanese. \n",
      "World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. \n",
      "Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August respectively. \n",
      "The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the permanent members of its Security Council. \n",
      " The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long Cold War. \n"
